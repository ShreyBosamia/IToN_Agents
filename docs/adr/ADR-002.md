# ADR-002: OpenAI API update to use web search + cURL to identify last modified date

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need to be able to check when a website was last updated. Sometimes a website can directly tell the last time it was updated but not always. We need to be able to find website updates.

**Decision:**
We will use OpenAI api and cURL tool to find when a website was last modified.

**Options Considered:**
* Do nothing(openAI agent only)
    * Minimal website header information received
* cURL
    * A specifically tested website may not have a last modified date header
* httpie
    * Doesn't pull enough information
* cURL + openAI api(chosen)
    * Finds related information and higher rate of modified date extraction

**Rationale:**
Using just openAI api queries allows us to find information but not always network information. If we can use openAI to find related information to a service located on our main foodbank website, and then use cURL to extract the modification date from those(links) then we can make sure the information about our services has transparency for last updated.

**Consequences:**
- Need to modify openAI to use web searching tool(will use later anyway)
- Will need to test openAI web searching abilities to find related links
- Learn how to use cURL and check for % of websites that can have their modified date be found
