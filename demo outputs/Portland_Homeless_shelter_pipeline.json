The sites complement the existing shelter system and provide a desperately needed low-barrier option for houseless populations that are not using available shelter beds.The goal is for every individual at these sites to develop their own specific plan on how to take the next best step in their life to leave behind the suffering of living unsheltered on the streets.Temporary Alternative Shelter Sites Data DashboardSite-specific Information: Clinton Triangle (1490 SE Gideon St.)N. Portland Road (10505 N. Portland Road)Site Services: Each site will have up to space to accommodate a range of shelter capacity from 40 to 250 people.Sites offering individual pods are designed with ADA accessibility in mind (doorway ramps added as needed). Pods can also shelter two individuals who seek to be togetherSome sites may be set up for RV residencyA small number of tent platforms for individuals who may not want to move into a pod right awayMeals: Average of one meal per day, plus snack (our experience reveals one meal is enough since not everyone eats the meal; there is typically enough food for those who seek 2 or 3 meals per day)Restrooms and showers, with some ADA-accessible restroomsLaundry access Community space for building connections and meeting with social workersDecompression areasPet areas Storage space for personal goodsAccess to public transit/transportation Electricity (i.e., for phone charging) Wi-fi Designated parking areasPerimeter fencing Regular trash collection and hazardous waste removal Livability enhancements like planter boxes, artwork, etc.Service Provider:After a careful review process, the City selected Urban Alchemy to manage the sites. Urban Alchemy brings extensive experience managing shelters and working with the homeless population. To serve the Portland locations, Urban Alchemy has hired extensively from the Portland community. More than 130 people have been hired locally. Urban Alchemy operates with a strong ethos of giving people a second chance. Their model is well-suited in providing services to a population of guests because many of their staff have survived similar challenges. 92% of Urban Alchemy’s overall organization staff are BIPOC. 96% have been incarcerated and/or experienced homelessness.At each location, Urban Alchemy and the City will provide:24/7 operations with 1 guest services staff for every 15 guests.Single point of entry and exit for guests at the site with 24/7 check in/out procedures.Daily access to care coordination managers who will help guest navigate the bureaucracy of social services (1 care coordination manager to every 20 guests).Access to medical professionals.Close coordination Multnomah County to use a Built For Zero client-centered public health approach to guide clients through the continuum of care. Referral-based entry system through the City of Portland. Walk-ins will not be allowed. Stay for an indefinite period of time. Though the intention is for an individual to use these sites temporarily before transitioning to other housing or care, there will be no specific time limit regarding length of stay.Referral Process and Outreach: The demand for shelter is high in Portland. Clinton Triangle Temporary Alternative Shelter Site is kept at maximum occupancy through a deliberate and controlled referral process. Because of this, there is no method to call and directly request space.  Instead, referrals to shelters are largely handled during interactions between City and County outreach workers and the homeless individuals they communicate with. Outreach workers help individuals find the most appropriate shelter and coordinate the steps to entering a shelter, as sometimes there are issues to work through. For instance, helping a person navigate issues with pets, friends or family, and personal possessions is all a part of preparing to enter a shelter.  Additionally, to respect the neighboring community and avoid lines, Temporary Alternative Shelter Sites are unable to accept walk-ins. Our current referral process keeps occupancy at shelter sites at maximum capacity. Walk-ins are not accepted to prevent confusion and/or lines of people waiting outside the site.  The best way to learn more about other shelter opportunities in the Portland area is to call 2-1-1 or visit the Joint Office of Homeless Services Shelter and Homeless Services webpage. These resources include links and contact information for shelter and service providers in the Portland area. The City of Portland, together with our County partners and the Joint Office of Homeless Services, prioritize efforts that help homeless individuals get off the street and into permanent housing. The City’s Street Services Coordination Center interacts daily with homeless Portlanders as they respond to reports of unsanctioned camps. During these interactions, outreach workers offer a limited number of immediately-available shelter beds, complimentary transportation to that bed with their immediate belongings, free storage for additional items, and other services.  Individuals living unsheltered on the street and seeking help to navigate their next steps can make a request here. Please be aware this form is not designed to be an immediate/emergency response system, nor is it a guarantee of shelter, but outreach workers will attempt to make contact and help individuals navigate their next steps.  Key Site Rules: Alcohol and drugs cannot be consumed in common areas/public spaces. No cooking or fires are allowed.  Each guest must agree to community guidelines that emphasize respect for their neighbor.Security: No guns or illegal weapons; any other potential weapon (e.g. pocket knives) will be securely stored before a guest can access the site.If an individual needs to be excluded from a site because a person is a clear / present danger to themselves or others, an Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team (ECIT) certified police officer may be requested to respond to the location by calling 9-1-1. Once the scene is determined to be safe, the ECIT certified police officer may request assistance from Portland Street Response (PSR).Perimeter Area: 24/7 hotline staffed by service provider for complaints or questions about the site or perimeter issues. On-site service provider will monitor an area of approximately 1,000 ft. surrounding the site to engage and communicate with neighbors, engage immediately to new unsanctioned campsites, and report incidents of illegal activities (drug dealing, etc).Light trash cleanup in the 1,000 ft. area and immediate reporting of large amounts of trash to the City’s Impact Reduction Team or Metro RID. Service provider will engage regularly with surrounding residents, clients, businesses, neighborhood associations, and Enhanced Service Districts. Parking: Sites will be chosen with availability of public transit in mind.Sites may include RV / car options. Parking availability and rules will be aligned to reduce impact on the surrounding community.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):Why not just build affordable housing?Temporary Alternative Shelter Sites will serve as a bridge to more permanent options, preparing unsheltered Portlanders for safe affordable housing while providing them with critical access to services. Will you meet with residents and/",

          "text": "Supportive housing services: Addressing homelessness in greater Portland\n        Rising housing costs and stagnant wages have led to a housing crisis and increased homelessness. Thanks to voters, funds are now available to support housing access and stability for people across greater Portland.\n      \n    \n    \n\n        \n\n  \n\n          \n\n\n\n  \n        \n\n  \nIn May 2020, voters in greater Portland approved Measure 26-210 to fund services for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Thanks to voters, Metro now works with Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties to reduce homelessness through programs and services that help people find and keep safe and stable homes. These include but are not limited to:Emergency services such as outreach and shelterPlacement into housingHelp paying rent (both emergency and long-term rent assistance)Advocacy and case managementServices in the areas of mental health, physical health, language and culture needs, education, employment, addiction and recovery, tenant rights and othersThe fund also strengthens and expands the systems that deliver these services.As the programming supported by the fund grows, community members can expect:Thousands more people will be living in permanent housing each yearPeople of color will have better access to services that meet their needs, and will retain permanent housing at higher rates than their representation in the homeless populationThousands of households will get help to avoid losing their homesFor most people who experience homelessness, it will be brief and only onceMore services will be available in areas that have been underservedOverall, fewer people will be living outside.Goals for the 10-year fund are to connect 5,000 homeless households with permanent supportive housing and stabilize 10,000 households at risk of or experiencing homelessness in permanent housing. The counties' goals for each fiscal year can be found in their Annual Work Plans.Wherever we come from, whoever we are, everyone deserves safe and stable housing.Read Metro’s supportive housing services work plan to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n  Supportive Housing Services program work plan\n\n      \n            \n                  \n            \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n PDF\n          \n                          333.61 KB\n                          Dec. 17, 2020\n              \n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n                  \n                    \n              Featured document\n            \n                            \n      \n      \n    \n            \n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n            \n\n  Metro Supportive Housing Services regional annual report July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024\n\n      \n            \n                  \n            \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n PDF\n          \n                          8.54 MB\n                          Feb. 11, 2025\n              \n      \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n                  \n                    \n              Annual county work plans\n            \n                            \n      \n              \n          To access past work plans, please email housinginfo@oregonmetro.gov.\n        \n      \n    \n            \n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n            \n\n  Clackamas County FY 2024-25 SHS annual work plan \n\n      \n            \n                  \n            \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n PDF\n          \n                          308.68 KB\n                          Aug. 30, 2024\n              \n      \n  \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n            \n\n  Multnomah County FY 2024-25 SHS annual work plan\n\n      \n            \n                  \n            \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n PDF\n          \n                          251.41 KB\n                          Aug. 30, 2024\n              \n      \n  \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n            \n\n  Washington County FY 2024-25 SHS annual work plan\n\n      \n            \n                  \n            \n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n PDF\n          \n                          402.59 KB\n                          Aug. 30, 2024\n              \n      \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n          \n        If you need help now\n      \n              \n        Metro does not provide services.

Most people experiencing homelessness have more than one barrier that needs to be overcome before they can secure appropriate long-term housing. Consistent support from many organizations is needed for people to obtain mental or physical health care, find income assistance, apply for housing, and navigate government agencies. Blanchet House is one organization working to help people end their homelessness.\n\nWe know that individuals experiencing homelessness first need necessities like food, clothing, and shelter to have the energy to tackle higher-level needs. Our meal services provide nourishment and our housing program offers stability. We hope these resources help build understanding, alleviate suffering, and lead to solutions.\n\nUnderstanding Homelessness\nLack of Affordable Housing  \nAverage Cost of Rent in Portland\nDiscrimination (LGBTQ, BIPOC) \nSubstance Abuse \nLack of Mental Health Services \nTrauma\nMaslow’s 5 Levels of Human Needs\n\n \n\nResources and Help For People Living Homeless\nOld Town InReach Program (OTIP) Team\nTransition Projects (TPI)\nVolunteer\nAdvocate\nMental Health Support: Listening is the First Step\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Clinics in Portland and Oregon\nSupport & Resources for People Living in Their Vehicles\nFree Public Showers in Portland\nRent Assistance in Oregon\n\n \n\nAddiction and Recovery Resources in Portland\nList of addiction treatment centers in Multnomah County.\nBlanchet Farm (9-month recovery program for men)\nBlanchet House (8-month recovery program for men)\nRecovery meetings and support \nAddiction and Mental Health Support for Veterans\nEasterseals – Housing Services for Veterans\n\n \n\nCommunity Resources\nHereTogether Oregon\nJoint Office of Homeless Services\nOld Town Community Association\nPSU Homeless Research & Action Collaborative\n\n \n\nNonprofit Sustainability Resources\nFood Recovery\n5 Ways to Run a More Sustainable Nonprofit Kitchen and Shelter \nSERVICES\n\nWe make a difference, one relationship at a time, through food, clothing, and supportive housing programs.\n\nLearn More\nLEARN\n\nWe welcome and serve meals to everyone with compassion and dignity.
