We provide short- and long-term support for participants to rent housing units throughout the metro area. During the past year alone, we helped more than 900 people secure housing. But our work doesn't end there. We remain engaged, providing the follow-up services critical to successful placements and ensuring that once housed, people stay housed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n\n.fe-6475494c91b05520579ab9b9 {\n  --grid-gutter: calc(var(--sqs-mobile-site-gutter, 6vw) - 11.0px);\n  --cell-max-width: calc( ( var(--sqs-site-max-width, 1500px) - (11.0px * (8 - 1)) ) / 8 );\n\n  display: grid;\n  position: relative;\n  grid-area: 1/1/-1/-1;\n  grid-template-rows: repeat(4,minmax(24px, auto));\n  grid-template-columns:\n    minmax(var(--grid-gutter), 1fr)\n    repeat(8, minmax(0, var(--cell-max-width)))\n    minmax(var(--grid-gutter), 1fr);\n  row-gap: 11.0px;\n  column-gap: 11.0px;\n  overflow-x: hidden;\n  overflow-x: clip;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  .background-width--inset .fe-6475494c91b05520579ab9b9 {\n    --inset-padding: calc(var(--sqs-site-gutter) * 2);\n  }\n\n  .fe-6475494c91b05520579ab9b9 {\n    --grid-gutter: calc(var(--sqs-site-gutter, 4vw) - 11.0px);\n    --cell-max-width: calc( ( var(--sqs-site-max-width, 1500px) - (11.0px * (24 - 1)) ) / 24 );\n    --inset-padding: 0vw;\n\n    --row-height-scaling-factor: 0.0215;\n    --container-width: min(var(--sqs-site-max-width, 1500px), cal",

We believe everyone deserves food, clothes, community, and hope.\n\nOn a mission to alleviate suffering and offer hope for a better life by serving essential aid with dignity.\nWhat We Do\nHot Meals\n\nThe Founders Café is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner Monday-Saturday. We serve freshly prepared, well-balanced meals to anyone who comes to our doors during meal hours.\n\nFarm Program\n\nBlanchet Farm, located one hour outside Portland, is a men’s transitional residential program that offers an opportunity to build a healthier, sober life in a rural setting.\n\nHouse Program\n\nThe downtown Portland residential program offers a free safe space to recover and refocus for 8 months. Through dignity and respect, we help you build towards the life you want.\n\nWomen’s Shelter\n\nWe’re completing renovations to open Bethanie’s Room, a women’s overnight shelter in NW Portland. The shelter will offer a safe place for up to 75 women per night.\n\nWays to Help\nVolunteer\n\nCompassionate people aged 14 and older are needed to serve meals, sort clothing, and more.

It can also play a critical role in recovery, helping to rebuild and maintain independence, develop day-to-day routines, and build confidence. This is especially true when housing includes access to support services. At New Narrative, we offer a variety of housing options to meet different needs.\nTransitional housing\n\nOur transitional housing sites aim to provide a safe and comfortable community as our participants figure out the next steps on their housing journey. These locations include onsite staffing with a focus on developing the resources, skills, knowledge, and planning needed to achieve the desired independent housing outcomes. We believe that with fewer housing barriers, and with a supportive team to walk alongside, participants can focus on thriving, not just surviving.\n\nPermanent supportive housing\n\nWe understand that people sometimes need a variety of supports to live their best life in the community. Our permanent supportive housing programs partner to provide resources to participants to thrive in their home. These sites include onsite staffing and offer a variety of therapeutic and operational resources and tools for living the most independent life. These are sites that participants can call a permanent home.\n\nIndependent housing\n\nNo matter who it is, having a safe and comfortable home is key to leading a good quality of life. Our independent housing sites are standalone apartment buildings kept at affordable rental rates to provide permanence to participants, particularly if facing discrimination and other barriers to housing. Suited to independence, these sites have no permanent staffing. If community-based services or a visit to one of our local clinics is requested per your referral, our property management team happily makes those connects.\n\nContact our New Narrative Property Management team to discuss low-income rental options. Call or text (971) 341-4111 or email Property@newnarrativepdx.org.\n\nCommunity Resources for housing placement\n\nWashington and Multnomah Counties manage screening for housing placement.\nIf you are located in Washington County, please call Community Connect at (503)640-3263 or email communityconnect@caowash.org.\n\nIf you are located in Multnomah County:\n\nAdults: Please contact the Coordinated Housing Access Team (CHAT) Hotline at 844-765-9384. You can also visit the Transition Projects website to complete an online pre-screening by filling out this form.\n\nFor culturally specific assessments for the BIPOC community, you can call/email the BIPOC CHAT Line at 503-280-2600 x 654 or housingreferrals@ulpdx.org.\n\nVeterans: Call the Veteran Services hotline at 855-425-5544.\n\nFamilies: Call 211 for assessment.\n\nDomestic Violence Survivors: Call to Safety 503-235-5333 or, for Spanish, Project UNICA 503-232-4448 (more info and resources for survivors)\n\nUnaccompanied Youth (Under age 25): Contact Janus Youth through their Access Center: 635 SW Alder St, Portland or 503-432-3986.\n\nYour support matters\nGet help now\nGive\nAdvocate\nEvents\nSubscribe\nJoin our team\nMedia toolkit\nFinancials\nTransparency In Coverage Health Plan\nFAQ\n\n© 2020 New Narrative.

Our least fortunate citizens live outside in dangerous, inhumane conditions while they wait for shelter or permanent housing. From 2017 to 2023, unsheltered homeless souls suffering on our streets increased from 1,668 to 3,944.35%\"Homeless Upon Arrival\"\n\n​.An individual who was homeless outside of Multnomah County and moved to be homeless in our community, and 21% of those “Homeless Upon Arrival” to Multnomah County are from “Out of State,” one of the highest rates in the nation.52%Portland Police Arrests Are of The Unsheltered  These arrests contributed to the doubling of police response times since 2016. The one thing that can significantly lower arrests: A Roof! Portlanders in emergency shelters and transitional housing, make up only 2% of all people booked into jail.33%Increase in Oregon Evictions\n\n.​Portland is in an affordable housing and housing shortage crisis like we’ve never experienced before. On average, more than 86% of these eviction filings have been for nonpayment since the covid eviction moratorium was lifted.Our MissionEnd unsheltered homelessness in Portland Our ObjectiveNo one, regardless of who they are, should suffer the cruelty and inhumanity of sleeping on the streets.We will swiftly end unsheltered homelessness in Portland by providing enough nighttime emergency shelters (staffed, rented, and repurposed trauma-informed facilities [e.g., community centers, churches, businesses] to shelter every unsheltered person in Portland. Learn MoreWho We AreWe are a collective of local and national leaders who are action-oriented, relentlessly optimistic, and deeply devoted to our communities and causes.With over a hundred years of combined experience delivering proven programs in communities that, in many cases, have ended unsheltered homelessness, we are committed to ending unsheltered homelessness in Portland. Learn More Why We ExistWe can only begin to repair, restore, and revitalize our city and citizens when every Portlander enjoys the basic need and dignity of a safe and warm place to sleep. We believe in a shared “Community Standard.” Our city’s shop owners and housed residents are just as entitled to expect that their doorways or sidewalks are free from their use as a bedroom or toilet as an unhoused person is to have a place to toilet as well as sleep safely and protected from the elements.Why We Can't WaitPortland now has the highest per capita unsheltered rate in the nation, not including six cities in California, resulting in a PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY.Unsheltered Homelessness is SkyrocketingUnsheltered homelessness has increased 136% since 2017Homeless Portlanders are Dying315 deaths among people experiencing homelessness in 2022Misery is on Display in All Four Corners of PortlandSadly, behind each blue dot that represents a campsite report are actual people, many of whom are our children, neighbors, former high school classmates, living in unsafe, unsanitary, and dangerous conditions. Disgracefully, one of these individuals will die tonight because we’ve reached the tragic level where Portland loses one homeless person per night for a host of reasons that include, but are not limited to overdose, homicide, suicide, fire, disease, and extreme weather. Campsite Reports - City of PortlandHoused Portlanders are Leaving\n\n​\n\n“Majority of Portland voters say they’d consider leaving if they could as crime, homeless concerns persist.” - Oregonian, Dec. 12, 2023We cannot wait another day.DONATEVOLUNTEERBE A SITE\nPARTNER\n    \n        \n    \n\n Join our initiative and help us end unsheltered  homelessness, now",
